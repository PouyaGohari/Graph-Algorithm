## Introduction

This repository provides implementations of graph-based algorithms designed to solve two distinct problems. Graph algorithms are powerful tools for solving problems involving networks, paths, and connections, and this project demonstrates their practical application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed the latest version of C++.
- You have a basic understanding of graph algorithms and data structures.

## Installation

To clone and run this repository locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/graph-based-algorithms.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
      ```sh
   cd Graph-Algorithm

## Usage

To compile and run the algorithms, use the following commands:
1. Compile the code:
      ```sh
   g++ -o output_file source_file.cpp
3. Run the executable:
   ```sh
   ./output_file
Replace output_file with the name you want for the compiled file and source_file.cpp with the name of the source file you want to compile.
